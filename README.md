RRDTure

<p><strong> Background.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">This project was born a long time ago, when I first got my hands on Raspberry Pi and started exploring <i>physical computing</i>. My first attempts, back in 2013, resulted in few corrupted temperature sensors, lots of tangled cable and few lines of Python code. Now I reminded myself of the dust covered project and decided to take it further.</p>
<p align="justify">My initial idea was simply to log temperatures into <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdtool.en.html" target="_blank"><i>Round Robin Database Tool (RRDTool)</i></a> and create simple graphs. While developing the web front-end for my project, I've decided to make more of it, added some extra features to graphs, polished website appearance and optimized data collection.</p>
<p align="justify">Alongside, I've created a sister project based on MySQL database for data colleciton and <a href="http://www.amcharts.com/" target="_blank"><i>AmCharts</i></a> for visualizaiton. Both work well.</p>
